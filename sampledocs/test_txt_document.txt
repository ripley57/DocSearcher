Guys, I don't know if I can continue to do this.  I'd be looking for 40% more $$$ than last time.

I think you'll find it well worth the money.

Hi Mark,

As we discussed before the holiday, we are very eager to get our hands on the latest design docs for the new cw9200.

We can make it financially attractive if you were able to help us out with that.
