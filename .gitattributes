# From https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes regarding "* text=auto":
# Automatic end-of-line conversion. If Git decides that the content is text, 
# its line endings are converted to LF on checkin. When the file has been 
# committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.
# Note: Converting to LF is known as "normalizing the file".
# This is a good default option for users who don't have core.autocrlf set.
# If the text attribute is unspecified, Git uses the core.autocrlf 
# configuration variable to determine if the file should be converted.
# (see "core.autocrlf" and the "git config" command: 
# https://github.com/ripley57/CW_Tools/blob/master/tools/git/git_config.txt).
* text=auto

# Normalize .bat files but ensure CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.bat eol=crlf

# Normalise .sh files but ensure LF line endings on checkout.
*.sh text eol=lf

# Do not attempt any end-of-line conversion upon checkin or checkout.

# Use the "macro" attribute "binary" to prevent any end-of-line 
# conversions or textual diffs. According to 
# https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes, this is equivalent to
# "*.jpg -text -diff".

# Note: After changing .gitattributes we should do this:
#
# git add --renormalize .
# git status        # Show files that will be normalized
# git commit -m "Introduce end-of-line normalization"
# 
# To prevent a specific file from being normalized:
# manual.pdf	-text   # Then run "git add -u"
#
# To request that a specific file be normalized:
# weirdchars.txt	text  # Then run "git add -u"
