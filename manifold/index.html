	<h3>Q & A</h3>

	<tr>
		<th>Q</th>
		<th>A</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="left">I'm running a filesystem crawl Job in ManifoldCF, but it won't process all the documents. The "Active" count value remains at a non-zero value, and tailing the Solr log shows repeated extraction errors. Also, none of the successfully-processed documents appear to be searchable in Solr. What's happening and what can I do?</td>
		<td align="left">Solr is erroring when extracting the content from some documents, and ManifoldCF is repeatedly sending the documents back to Solr to be indexed. This is because ManifoldCF is not interpreting the error code from Solr as a fatal failure (or potentially Solr might be returning an incorrect failure code). To get around this, click "Abort" for the Job in ManifoldCF. The erroring documents will remain unprocessed, but those already successfully sent to Solr should now be searchable.</td>

	 <p><strong>Note:</strong> The first few chapters of the <i>Manifold In Action</i> book include some very good basic examples of how to configure and use ManifoldCF. However, due to changes in the ManifoldCF UI, the steps only appear to be correct for older versions (including version 1.9).</p>
