The Ant build.xml file was generated from Eclipse, using "File > Export > General > Ant Buildfiles". 

So, you should be able to build the project either from Eclipse or from the command-line (if you need to). 

I generated the build.xml file because I was thinking of adding a jar target, since that seems to be another thing that is only generated from Eclipse using "File > Export".
