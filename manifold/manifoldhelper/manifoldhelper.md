# Manifold Helper  

## Proposal  
For a given file system directory to index, automate the generation of the ManifoldCF repository connector, the output connector and the job. 

## Design ideas brainstorm  
* Create a program input argument parser class. A separate class should make unit testing easier, and should also increase reusability 
in future Java projects.
* Create a language parser class and define a simple meta language to drive the application, e.g.
"CREATE MANIFOLD JOB ...". This should make unit testing easier, should make the program usage clear, and we can easily add new commands 
later, such as "DELETE MANIFOLD JOB...", etc. Investigate use of JavaCC for the parsing: https://javacc.org/.
* The Parser class should return the parsed language as XML. 
* Class to transform the XML returned from the parser into JSON for the various Manifold HTTP requests we require (maybe useful: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/xslt/transformingXML.html). 
* How do we execute these JSON objects? Perhaps we can "post" them onto a "Blackboard", then a consumer can come along and ask for them, e.g. "give me all create repository objects". Maybe we can do more (all) things via the Blackboard, e.g. post the language statement to parse, etc.
